Neurelo offers several key features aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of working with databases. These features include:

1. **Auto-Generated APIs**: Neurelo automatically generates REST and GraphQL endpoints from your database schemas, facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and advanced read/write data operations. This significantly reduces the need for writing tedious boilerplate database code, as the app's data becomes instantly accessible from any client. These APIs are automatically documented and evolve in harmony with schema changes, updating and versioning as modifications are made.

2. **Custom Query APIs with AI Assist**: The platform integrates an LLM-based AI engine that assists in building and instantly deploying custom API endpoints for complex queries. This feature includes a Schema Aware AI with NLP capabilities, enabling seamless code generation to support complex queries. It is pre-trained on each databaseâ€™s query language, which simplifies handling different databases used in an application. Additionally, there are query controls for API endpoints to maintain application predictability, including rate-limits, timeouts, and restrictions based on the request's origin.

3. **Query Observability**: Neurelo provides complete transparency for data operations with detailed metrics for each endpoint. This feature includes visibility into API performance and usage, detailed database access patterns, and heatmaps across all reads and writes. It also offers query-level insights, helping understand and address issues like slow queries or long-running queries. Moreover, it provides tailored optimizations with performance and operational recommendations based on your data access patterns, augmented with AI.

4. **Schema as Code**: This feature offers a programmable data modeling experience with version control, governance, and collaboration. Users can code their schema in JSON or YAML, creating it from scratch or auto-generating from existing databases. This approach allows for faster and safer deployment of new features, with version control and collaboration across development, testing, and production environments as the schema evolves. It also ensures a consistent programmable data modeling experience across both SQL and NoSQL databases.

Each of these features contributes to Neurelo's goal of reducing the complexities and increasing the efficiency of database-related programming, making it a comprehensive tool for developers working with various databases and applications.
